* Added support for moonscript: Simply a possibility at the moment (future implementations if feasiable)
-> moon script.moon (runs moonscript code file)
-> moonc script.moon (compiles moonscript code to lua)

* The window is now transparent like I wanted, but everything drawn upon it is also invisible, I tried the same
approach with pygame but it didn't interfere with objects blit onto the screen, something love2d isn't capable of 
handling
* Find a way to display game objects (while maintaining the love2d screen's transparency of 100%)
