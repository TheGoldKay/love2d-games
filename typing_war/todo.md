`The spaceship will move automatically, the player will only type`
`Once they start typing, the spaceship will lock onto the target word by itself`
`It will fire in a straight live, one bullet for each typed letter`

`Must find a way to structure the wordlist and give words from the smaller side first`
`All others on the screen must start with a unquie letter`
`That's how the ship locks on the word by the first press `
`The lock won't end till the word is destroyed`
`All letters must be pressed in the correct order`
